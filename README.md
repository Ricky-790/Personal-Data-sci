# Machine Learning Exploration Repository

This repository will contain a series of Jupyter notebooks that I create as I explore and learn machine learning. I plan to use this repository as a way to keep track of and share my progress and receive feedback from others, as well as learn from them.

## Repository Structure

### Data

The `data` folder contains the training datasets used in the Jupyter notebooks. You can download these datasets and use them to follow along with the examples and experiments in the notebooks.

### Notebooks

The `files` folder contains the Jupyter notebooks created. Almost all notebooks are created following the book `Hands on machine learning with scikit-learn and tensorflow`
