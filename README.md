# Machine Learning Exploration Repository

This repository will contain a series of Jupyter notebooks that I create as I explore and learn machine learning. I plan to use this repository as a way to keep track of and share my progress and receive feedback from others, as well as learn from them.

## Repository Structure

### Data

The `data` folder contains the training datasets used in my Jupyter notebooks. You can download these datasets and use them to follow along with the examples and experiments in the notebooks.

### Notebooks

In each notebook, I will attempt to describe a specific ML concept or method, provide examples, or tackle problem statements (such as house price prediction and such)
Almost all notebooks are created following the book `Hands on machine learning with scikit-learn and tensorflow`

## Table of Contents

Here's a brief overview of the notebooks you'll find in this repository:
* House_price_pred.ipynb: House price prediction data exploration and model building
* 03_classification.ipynb: Classification tasks with ML (MNIST dataset)
* titanic_practice.ipynb: Classification practice with the titanic dataset
* tensors: tensorflow datatypes
* core_algos : Core algorithms used in ML
* neural_nets : Starting with neural networks
* Convolutional neural nets: Staring with computer vision
