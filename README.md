This repository will contain a series of Jupyter notebooks that I create as I explore and learn machine learning. I plan to use this repository as a way to keep track of and share my progress and receive feedback from others, as well as learn from them.

In each notebook, I will attempt to describe a specific ML concept or method, provide examples, or tackle problem statements (such as house price prediction and such)
